# Shop

This is the front-end part of the 'Shop' project. I worked on this project while going through the Udemy course [Full Stack: Angular and Java Spring Boot E-Commerce Website](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-angular-spring-boot-tutorial/).

## ðŸ’¡ Functionality

Anonymous users can log in, view a list of products, and see product details.  
Authenticated users can add products to the cart, make purchases, and view their order history.

## ðŸ”‘ Value of the Project

Through this project, I learned the basics of Angular, Spring REST, and Okta (Identity and access management solution). The most important part was understanding how the backend and frontend work together and communicate with each other. Additionally, I gained knowledge about securing requests and the concept of JWT (JSON Web Tokens). I used the Stripe API for payment processing.

## ðŸš€ Development Server

1. Run npm install --force --legacy-peer-deps to download dependencies.
2. Run npm start to start the development server. Navigate to https://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.
